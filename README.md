# raspberrypi
Script to setup my hardware when first flashed to run things the way I want them.

## Purpose
Setting up nginx to be configured securely was such a pain the first time that I did it that I decided to automate the process, because I never wanted to have to manually go through the steps again.

Since then, this script has grown to support a much wider array of customizations out of the box, including reclaiming gigabytes of data by removing unnecessary bloatware.

I'm a firm believer in the notion that everything should be customizable, and this project was designed to reflect and embody that. The `setup.sh` file can be modified by commenting and uncommenting lines to enable or disable certain functionalities depending on your use case for your Pi, because not every machine will serve the purpose that I intend for my Pi to serve.

Enjoy the project, and feel free to make contributions via PR's or suggestions via GitHub issues!

## Usage
1. `git clone https://github.com/ajmeese7/raspberrypi && cd raspberrypi`
2. `sudo sh ./setup.sh`
3. Sit back and relax, it's going to be a while!
